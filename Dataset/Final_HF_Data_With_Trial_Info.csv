During the prodromal stage, there are three main clusters of syndromes, including hypomania/mania symptoms, depressive symptoms, and signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (Correll et al., 2007; Tillman et al., 2003; Mantere et al., 2008). Of the hypomania/mania symptoms, decreased sleep, elevated mood, irritability, mood lability, increased energy, and psychomotor agitation are present most frequently. The prodromal depressive symptoms are reported to be depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia, feelings of worthlessness. Among patients with bipolar disorders, 22.5% reported to comorbid with pediatric ADHD. In addition, some symptoms are considered as non-specific such as decreased functioning, anger outburst, social isolation, and anxiety (Egeland et al., 2000).~Offspring of parents with bipolar disorders are much likely to present prodromal symptoms compared to offspring of healthy parents.

During the screening period, offspring of parents with bipolar disorder will undergo systematically clinical evaluations. The offspring will be evaluated with clinical symptoms assessing scales, neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging. During the 3-month trial period, the offspring who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive treatment of aerobic exercise, placebo, or wait-list group.

During the prodromal stage, there are three main clusters of syndromes, including hypomania/mania symptoms, depressive symptoms, and signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (Correll et al., 2007; Tillman et al., 2003; Mantere et al., 2008). Of the hypomania/mania symptoms, decreased sleep, elevated mood, irritability, mood lability, increased energy, and psychomotor agitation are present most frequently. The prodromal depressive symptoms are reported to be depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia, feelings of worthlessness.

A trend towards reduced mortality associated with the use of high-dose intravenous PPI was also observed. Recent clinical trials from Asia have provided evidence that high-dose oral PPIs are associated with a reduction in rebleeding. Current meta-analysis suggests that both high dose (intravenous) and low dose (oral) PPIs effectively reduce rebleeding vs placebo. However, there has been no clinical study to compare IV infusion to oral PPI in this patient population.~The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral Esomeprazole in patients with peptic ulcer hemorrhage who are at risk for recurrent bleeding. The investigators hypothesize that using IV infusion is superior to oral PPI."

Nowadays, despite the availability of good diagnostic capacities, undifferentiated febrile illnesses continue to be a thorny problem for travel physicians. In developing countries, the scarcity of skilled personnel and adequate laboratory facilities makes the differential diagnosis of fevers even more complex. Health care workers must often rely on syndrome-oriented empirical approaches to treatment and might overestimate or underestimate the likelihood of certain diseases. For instance Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) contribute substantially to the burden of persistent (more than 1 week) fevers in the Tropics, causing considerable mortality and major disability. These diseases are however rarely diagnosed at primary health care (PHC) level. The difficulty in establishing the cause of febrile illnesses has resulted in omission or delays in treatment, irrational prescriptions with polytherapy, increasing cost and development of drug resistance.~In resource-limited settings, clinical algorithms constitute a valuable aid to health workers, as they facilitate the therapeutic decision in the absence of good laboratory capacities. There is a critical lack of appropriate diagnostic tools to guide treatment of NTDs. While clinical algorithms have been developed for some NTDs, in most cases they remain empirical. Besides, they rarely take into account local prevalence data, do not adequately represent the spectrum of patients and differential diagnosis at the primary care level and often have not been properly validated. The purpose of the study is to develop evidence-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-supported diagnostic guidelines for patients with persistent fever (≥ 1 week) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Cambodia and Nepal."

There is a critical lack of appropriate diagnostic tools to guide treatment of NTDs. While clinical algorithms have been developed for some NTDs, in most cases they remain empirical.

Patients with stroke routinely undergo 24 hours of continuous cardiac telemetry during hospitalization for stroke as a means of excluding AF. Small studies indicate that extending the duration of monitoring with portable outpatient telemetry devices detects more cases of AF. However, these studies are small and lack control groups, and cannot demonstrate that prolonged cardiac monitoring detects more cases of AF than routine clinical follow-up. The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to determine the feasibility of randomizing patients to prolonged cardiac monitoring or routine clinical follow-up. The investigators will enroll 40 consecutive adult patients seen at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) Neurovascular service with cryptogenic stroke or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score 4 or greater). Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion. Group A will be assigned to wear an ambulatory cardiac event monitor for 21 days. Group B will be discharged home without a monitor and will serve as controls during routine clinical follow-up. The investigators' primary outcome will be feasibility, defined as more than 80% of randomized patients completing full clinical follow-up and more than 70% of cardiac monitoring if applicable. The investigators' secondary outcomes will be diagnoses of AF at 90 days and 1 year and diagnoses of recurrent stroke at 1 year."

NIDIAG aims to develop an improved, patient-centred system for delivering primary health care in resource-constrained settings. NIDIAG will investigate three clinical syndromes, namely (i) persistent digestive disorders, (ii) persistent fever and (iii) neurological disorders, due to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The current study focuses on persistent digestive disorders, which are defined as diarrhoea or abdominal pain that last for at least 2 weeks.~While acute diarrhoea has been studied globally, few research activities have focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of long-lasting diarrhoeal episodes (2 weeks and longer) in the tropics. The spectrum of possibly involved pathogens includes more than 30 bacterial, parasitic and viral infectious agents. This lack of data may be explained by the fact that people suffering from NTDs might only seek care at a late stage of the disease. Furthermore, health systems in affected regions are often weak and their primary health-care centres are often under-staffed and lack essential diagnostic equipment.~The hypothesis of this study is that development of an evidence-based syndromic approach can lead to better diagnosis and management of NTDs in patients with persistent digestive disorders. The study will be carried out in two West African countries (Côte d'Ivoire and Mali) and in two Asian countries (Indonesia and Nepal). The study will follow a case-control design and patients and controls will be prospectively enrolled. In order to address the knowledge gaps, three specific objectives will be pursued. First, the contribution of NTDs to the 'persistent digestive disorders syndrome' will be assessed. Second, the value of clinical features and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the diagnosis of target NTDs that give rise to persistent digestive disorders will be determined. Third, the clinical response to standard empiric and targeted treatment of several NTDs in patients with persistent digestive disorders will be evaluated. These objectives will provide a long-term benefit for the communities by improving the clinical decision-making process for the target NTDs and thus, better diagnostic work-up and patient management can be achieved in the study countries and other similar resource-constrained countries"
